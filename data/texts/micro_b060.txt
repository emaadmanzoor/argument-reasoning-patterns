Should shopping malls generally be allowed to open on holidays and Sundays?

a1: Owner-run shops may potentially be overwhelmed by additional work times on Sundays and holidays,
a2: then again supermarkets and large shopping centres dominate the market today already.
a3: Thus smaller shops could benefit from the additional freedom,
a4: as customers are on average more laid-back on Sunday.
a5: Opening on Sundays and holidays would therefore help both customers and shops.
