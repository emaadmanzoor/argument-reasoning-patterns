Should the fine for leaving dog excrements on sideways be increased?

a1: Pieces of dog poo on the pavements are a real danger.
a2: Time and again children or the elderly slip on them.
a3: A fine for leaving dog waste behind admittedly seems rather authoritarian,
a4: but similar rules are often in place for bicycles on park paths, after all.
a5: Increasing penalties is therefore the right way.
a6: A dog dirt-free city will be more attractive not only for its residents but also for tourists!
