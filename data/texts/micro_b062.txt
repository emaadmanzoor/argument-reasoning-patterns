Should the statutory retirement age remain at 63 years in the future?

a1: I am not of the opinion that the retirement age should be set at 63 years.
a2: This would mean that organizations would be lacking a great deal of manpower in the future.
a3: The introductory phase of retirement at 63 would also be a particular challenge
a4: as upon introduction many current employees of advanced age would immediately be eligible to retire. This is detrimental for Germany as a business location and leaves employers without a transition period. The danger here is that experienced junior staff is not available in sufficient numbers.
