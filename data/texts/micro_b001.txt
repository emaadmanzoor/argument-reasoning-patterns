Should we continue to separate our waste for recycling?

a1: Yes, it's annoying and cumbersome to separate your rubbish properly all the time.
a2: Three different bin bags stink away in the kitchen and have to be sorted into different wheelie bins.
a3: But still Germany produces way too much rubbish and too many resources are lost when what actually should be separated and recycled is burnt.
a5: We Berliners should take the chance and become pioneers in waste separation!
