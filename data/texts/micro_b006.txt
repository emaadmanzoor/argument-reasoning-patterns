Should Germany introduce the death penalty?

a1: The death penalty is a legal means that as such is not practicable in Germany.
a2: For one thing, inviolable human dignity is anchored in our constitution,

a4: Even if many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person,
a5: this is precisely the crime that we should not repay with the same.
