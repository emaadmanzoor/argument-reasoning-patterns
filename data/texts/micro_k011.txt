Should there be a cap on rent increases for a change of tenant?

a1: Rent increases upon re-letting aren't bad as such, if it's only a small amount,
a10: they’re very bad however, if the rent suddenly climbs by €100 or €200.
a2: With those kinds of amounts you think twice about whether you really want to stay in the flat.
a3: If there must be rent increases, there should also be a cap to avoid nasty surprises.
a4: This helps the landlords,
a5: as they can adjust their expenses through the increase,
a6: and also the tenants,
a7: as they can plan for a maximum rent increase.
a8: That the landlords are then slightly restricted in the administration of their property is not a problem,
a9: as they have more pull in the end anyway.
