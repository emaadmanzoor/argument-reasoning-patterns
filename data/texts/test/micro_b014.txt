Should only those viewers pay a TV licence fee who actually want to watch programs offered by public broadcasters?

a1: Actually only those people should pay a TV & radio licence fee who really watch ARD, ZDF, Arte etc.
a2: It is in fact good to support sophisticated programming through fees.
a3: Curiously, however, there are still adverts and product placements on the public channels.
a4: What are you paying for, then? That the same actors time and again get to have a laugh at exotic shooting locations?
a5: Also the scripts are often copied off each other.
