Should school uniforms be worn again in our schools?

a1: Some may find the idea of a school uniform anachronistic,
a2: or regard it as too much of an intervention into the leeway of students and parents to make decisions.
a3: Indeed, however, it's already the case today that students of apparently 'uniform-free' schools are essentially wearing a uniform consisting of certain brand-name garments.
a4: A simply designed practical outfit would even out the overall visual image of a school, and direct attention towards the character and achievements of the students - and not their buying power.
