Should only those viewers pay a TV licence fee who actually want to watch programs offered by public broadcasters?

a1: Considering what's on television these days, it would be appropriate to only have those people pay who actually (want to) follow the programming.
a2: In some cases there are only shows for older generations on at prime times, so why then should everyone pay for this?
a3: By now you have advertising on all channels,
a4: so there's no advantage for the current paying viewers of the public broadcasters.
a5: Nevertheless one has to point out that there'd probably be way fewer stations if it weren’t the whole of Germany that’s obliged to pay.
a6: That shouldn't be an issue though, given the sheer number of programmes and stations that essentially show the same things anyway.
