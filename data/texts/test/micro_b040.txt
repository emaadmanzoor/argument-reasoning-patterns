Should the fine for leaving dog excrements on sideways be increased?

a1: There should be much higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements.
a2: Stepping in dog dirt is gross and absolutely ruins your day
a3: due to the dirt, the stench and the often considerable effort to get rid of it.
a4: Besides, the fines for public urination by a human are higher than for leaving behind dog dirt on the pavement, which is disproportionate.
a5: Some dog owners assume that paying a dog licence fee covers the removal of such waste,
a6: but according to this logic one could hardly make the taxpayer accountable for almost any offense.
