Should shopping malls generally be allowed to open on holidays and Sundays?

a1: Supermarkets and shopping centres should be allowed to open any Sundays and holidays at their discretion.
a2: For in this way, Sunday shopping days would be better spread out through the year.
a3: Also streets and shops would presumably be emptier
a4: as not everyone would be open on the same day.
a5: However then you'd have a worse overview of which shop is open on a given day.
