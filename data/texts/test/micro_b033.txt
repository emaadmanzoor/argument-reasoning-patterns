Should parts of the Tempelhofer Feld be made available for residential construction?

a1: I find the peripheral housing development at Tempelhofer Feld right for urban planning reasons,
a2: as the area is right in the middle of the city (capital).
a3: The size of the field allows for both housing and generous open space.
