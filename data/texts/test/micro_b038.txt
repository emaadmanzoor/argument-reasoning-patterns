Should school uniforms be worn again in our schools?

a1: School uniforms should be introduced in our schools again.
a2: This provides an at least superficial equalization in our heavily economically oriented society,
a3: which may reduce discrimination of financially and/or socially disadvantaged children.
a4: Furthermore, it would facilitate the finding of truants, who may wish to get away with fewer classes at school.
a5: Uniforms always and immediately provoke fear of losing one's individuality
a6: but what's really lacking in schools today is rather a real sense of community, which would possibly be strengthened by an equal, collective appearance.
