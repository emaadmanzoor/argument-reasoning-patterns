Should only those viewers pay a TV licence fee who actually want to watch programs offered by public broadcasters?

a1: The TV/radio licence fee can only be required of all citizens/households equally.
a2: Critics point out that they are not using what's on offer by public broadcasting.
a3: I do doubt that there is anyone who has never at least indirectly watched the programming of the public broadcasters.
a4: However, it is impossible to monitor this and collect more customized fees.
a5: Just as with other choices in culture or infrastructure, public broadcasters are also to be financed, regardless of whether individuals make use of their programming or not.
