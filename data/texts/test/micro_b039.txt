a1: The EU should exert influence on the political events in Ukraine.
a2: The developments in that conflict should not be left to former Cold War opponents alone,
a3: for that course can only lead to escalation in some form.
a4: Furthermore, Ukraine is culturally and geographically much closer than other countries that the EU (used to) get involved with.
a5: Indeed one could argue that a country has to deal with internal political changes itself,
a6: but political power also brings about political responsibility, in this case the responsibility to protect the Ukrainian people from the rather strong interests of the two Great Powers.
