Should parts of the Tempelhofer Feld be made available for residential construction?

a1: For years there has been a housing shortage in Berlin,
a2: so that using Tempelhofer Feld, which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed, as living space is a sensible idea.
a3: Since the area belongs to the federal state, or the federation,
a4: it could even be used for social housing with affordable rents.
a5: Admittedly the fields have currently become an attractive leisure park with sporting areas for many visitors and Berliners, especially in spring and summer.
a6: If however one could find a compromise between green space and housing, then Tempelhofer Feld should definitely be made available for residential construction.
