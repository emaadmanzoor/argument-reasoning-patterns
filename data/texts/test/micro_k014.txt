a1: Intelligence services should be more closely regulated by parliament,
a2: for, as the most recent NSA wiretapping scandal has shown, the federal state government is allegedly not always familiar with the scope of operations of its intelligence services.

a4: Yet it remains questionable whether the actual implementation of such supervision would at the same time lead to a stronger observance of laws,
a5: as ultimately this decision is in the hands of the respective government leaders.
