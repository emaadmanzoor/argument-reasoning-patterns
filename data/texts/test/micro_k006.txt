Should Germany introduce the death penalty?

a1: If Germany were to introduce the death penalty, convicted felons could not be paroled or break out of prison and commit new felonies.
a2: However, a death would not be of any more use to those affected and their relatives than if the felon receives a long sentence.
a3: Plus we don't live in medieval times anymore.
a4: Handing out capital punishment is unethical.
a5: We don't need it.
