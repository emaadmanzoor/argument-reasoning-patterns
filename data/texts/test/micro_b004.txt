Should only those viewers pay a TV licence fee who actually want to watch programs offered by public broadcasters?

a1: Of course there are a number of programmes in public broadcasting that are not worth the licencing fee,
a2: and others, such as “Musikantenstadl” and soap operas, are only interesting to certain audiences.
a3: Nevertheless, everybody should contribute to the funding of the public broadcasters in equal measure,
a4: for we need general and independent media.
a5: After all we want to get our view of the world neither through the lens of the government nor through that of rich media entrepreneurs.
