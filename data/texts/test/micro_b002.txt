a1: One can hardly move in Friedrichshain or Neuk√∂lln these days without permanently scanning the ground for dog dirt.
a2: And when bad luck does strike and you step into one of the many 'land mines' you have to painstakingly scrape the remains off your soles.

a4: Of course, first they'd actually need to be caught in the act by public order officers,
a5: but once they have to dig into their pockets, their laziness will sure vanish!
