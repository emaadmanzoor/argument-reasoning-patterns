Should the statutory retirement age remain at 63 years in the future?

a1: Germany's aging society is undergoing demographic change,
a2: and the age of those who are physically and mentally fit is increasing steadily.
a3: Thus social security and pension costs are increasing.
a4: Yet no one should be required to work for more than 40 years.
a5: Raising the relative retirement age on the basis of the physical fitness of the average citizen is fair.
