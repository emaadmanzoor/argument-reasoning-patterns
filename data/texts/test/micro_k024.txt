Should the fine for leaving dog excrements on sideways be increased?

a1: Dog owners should pay higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements,
a2: although there aren't enough bins and bag-dispensers for dog dirt.
a3: One reason for this is that they have thus far hardly had to fear the consequences despite the obligation to clean up.
a4: A higher fine, so dog owners would have to dig deeper into their pockets, is supposed to be a deterrent after all.
a5: The city, especially the green spaces, should be kept tidy after all,
a6: for they are there for our recreation.
a7: Besides you're not allowed to leave other rubbish without punishment.
