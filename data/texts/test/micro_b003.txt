a1: Health insurance companies should not cover treatment in complementary medicine
a2: unless the promised effect and its medical benefit have been concretely proven.
a3: Yet this very proof is lacking in most cases.
a4: Patients do often report relief of their complaints after such treatments.
a5: But as long as it is unclear as to how this works, the funds should rather be spent on therapies where one knows with certainty.
