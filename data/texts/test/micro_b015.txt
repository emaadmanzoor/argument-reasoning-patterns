Should shopping malls generally be allowed to open on holidays and Sundays?

a1: Well, I as an employee find it very practical to be able to shop at least on weekends.
a2: Sure, other people have to work in the shops on the weekend,
a3: but they can have days off during the week and run errands at their leisure while I'm stuck in the office.
a4: Plus, the state wants me to spend my money, and how am I supposed to do that when the shops aren't open when I'm off work?
