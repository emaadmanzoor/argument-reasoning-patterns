Should Germany introduce the death penalty?

a1: Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment.
a2: If there were capital punishment, this would mean people are allowed to put themselves above others and rule over their lives.
a3: Capital punishment would be murder and would have to be punished with the death penalty itself.
a4: What, then, ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should they simply be allowed to live on
a5: although they have taken or destroyed another life?
a6: Yes, for it is a much graver punishment to be imprisoned forever and be tortured by one's own thoughts than to be killed quickly and easily by an injection.
