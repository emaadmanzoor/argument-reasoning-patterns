a1: Usually you only have eight weeks to complete a bachelor thesis in linguistics degrees. Adjusting the portion of the total grade upwards anyway would not be commensurate to other study assignments and examinations.

a4: Indeed the preparation of such a scientific work is a fundamental competency that must be acquired in philological degrees.
a5: Throughout the six or seven semesters, however, topics are covered that likewise ought to carry weight.
