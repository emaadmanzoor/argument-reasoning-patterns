Should there be a cap on rent increases for a change of tenant?

a1: A stop must be put to exorbitant rents by imposing a limit on rent increases when changing residences.
a2: For affordable living space is scarce.
a3: Besides, a higher degree of luxury (expensive flats) is not necessary for the majority of the people, but rather a flat at all.
a4: Plus everyone has to move approx. 3-10 times in his or her life,
a5: because the size of the desired accommodation changes over the course of a lifetime.
