Should all universities in Germany charge tuition fees?

a1: German universities should on no account charge tuition fees.
a2: This would simply mean that only those people with wealthy parents or a previous education and a part-time job while studying would be able to apply for a degree programme in the first place.
a3: Even without tuition fees half of the student population has to work while studying and hence has less time for studying or recreation.
a4: One could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped.
a5: But what is the good of a wonderfully outfitted university if it doesn't actually allow the majority of clever people to broaden their horizons with all that great equipment?
