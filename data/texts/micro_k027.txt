Should only those viewers pay a TV licence fee who actually want to watch programs offered by public broadcasters?

a1: The TV license fee should only be collected from those who actually make use of the programming of the public broadcasters.
a2: After all there are many people in Germany who pay the fee although they merely use a computer to work.
a3: Yet the fees are demanded from everybody who does not apply for a waiver, no matter how many receiver devices actually exist in the household and how they are being used.
a4: However it is obvious that the license fee officers are not in a position to check the usage of every single device.
