Should there be a cap on rent increases for a change of tenant?

a1: It is unfair and unjustifiable that new tenants have to pay a much higher rent than previous residents.
a2: Clearly the landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease.
a3: But surely these costs could be covered by a minimal increase in rent over the course of the entire lease.
a4: All the more so as for an adequate profit the rental rate as compared to the base rent need not be raised for every new lease.
