Should Germany introduce the death penalty?

a1: Capital punishment is not a solution,
a2: as it cannot be ruled out that the judicial process may make mistakes.
a3: Criminals should not be put in luxury prisons, though.
a4: After all there are criminals who enjoy 'living' in prison for its decent board, no taxes to be paid, no stress with work.
a5: Still, the state needs the death penalty as a deterrent to horrific crimes.
