Should the fine for leaving dog excrements on sideways be increased?

a1: Higher penalties for dog dirt are pointless as long as there is not enough personnel to enforce them.
a2: In individual cases they may indeed act as a deterrent,
a3: in general, however, a clean environment and the role model effect of others is more likely to motivate the dog owner to pick up the droppings than a potential fine.
