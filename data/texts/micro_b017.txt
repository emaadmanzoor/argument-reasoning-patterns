Should there be a cap on rent increases for a change of tenant?

a1: Rent prices should be limited by a cap when there's a change of tenant.
a2: Landlords may want to earn as much as possible,
a3: and many, consistent with market principles, are prepared to pay higher rents,
a4: but that people with the same income suddenly must pay more and can't live in the same flat anymore seems implausible.
a5: Gentrification destroys entire districts and their culture.
