Should there be a cap on rent increases for a change of tenant?

a1: Rent prices are already regulated in favour of tenants due to existing laws and the rent index.
a2: In view of the high prices for buying flats with existing rent contracts, these are an unattractive investment.
a3: Even if one might think that additional rent control is needed besides the current tenant protection,
a4: one should not deny longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their returns to market level.
a5: A cap on rent increases upon tenant change is therefore not to be supported.
