Should the the morning-after pill be sold over the counter at the pharmacy?

a1: The state ought not to restrict medical products or medical treatments for moral reasons as long as they don't do damage to others.
a2: But without a prescription requirement there's also no medical advice given before intake.
a3: Since the impact of the morning-after pill is so massive, particularly due to its abortive effect,
a4: dispensing it without medical advice would be inappropriate.
a5: Easy access to the morning-after pill could also result in its appearing to be an easier method than other forms of contraception that, however, have fewer health effects.
a6: For instance the morning-after pill could result in a decrease in the use of condoms and thus lead to an increase in new infections with Aids.
