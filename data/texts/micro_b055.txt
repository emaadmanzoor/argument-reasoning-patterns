Should the the morning-after pill be sold over the counter at the pharmacy?

a1: Being a pharmacist myself,
a2: I argue categorically in favour of over-the-counter availability of the morning-after pill in pharmacies.
a3: From a medical perspective the morning-after pill works best when taken as soon as possible after intercourse. Always having to visit the doctor first (including travel and waiting time, possible embarrassment, etc.) leads to more unwanted pregnancies.
a5: Many opponents of the pill point out that this does away with the consultation at the doctor's and many women take it unnecessarily.
a6: However, the fact is that we pharmacists are legally required to inform the patients and possess the same subject matter expertise as doctors.
