Should all universities in Germany charge tuition fees?

a1: Actually it would be justified if all German universities charged tuition fees.
a2: As long as it is ensured that the funds really benefit the universities directly, one can continue to regard this as social justice.
a3: Those who study later decide this early on, anyway.
a4: It's always possible to take out a student loan or to earn a scholarship.
a5: To oblige non-academics to finance others' degrees through taxes, however, is not just.
