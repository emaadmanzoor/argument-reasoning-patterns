Should shopping malls generally be allowed to open on holidays and Sundays?

a1: Due to the increase in opening hours on Sundays and holidays there is a rise in employment.
a2: However it's mainly temps (that is, students, pupils etc.) who are employed,
a3: so this has hardly any effect on the level of full-time employment and the number of unemployed.
a4: On top of that, private and family life suffers massively because of this reduction and shifting in designated off-times.
a5: And itâ€™s only the large companies that can afford the additional personnel expenditure.
a6: For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays.
