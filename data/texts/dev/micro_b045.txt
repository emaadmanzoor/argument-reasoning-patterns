Should Germany by CDs with tax evader data from dubious sources?

a1: By purchasing illegally acquired tax data of citizens, the state is not only turning itself into a felon, but it is paying criminals, too.
a2: Besides, the purchase of such CDs is unnecessary today,
a3: as, due to changed terms of business, many banks urge their customers to turn themselves in.
a4: Acquiring CDs with tax data of tax delinquents is therefore out of the question.
a5: It is indisputable, however, that by purchasing such data the state increases the pressure on tax evaders to turn themselves in.
