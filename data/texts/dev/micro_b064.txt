Should the Berlin Tegel airport remain operational after the opening of the Berlin Brandenburg airport?

a1: I think Berlin with its two inner-city airports was lucky not having to experience an airplane catastrophe for decades.
a2: For safety reasons alone I find continued operation wrong.
a3: Also, Berlin urgently needs inner-city areas for business and industry, and for housing.
a4: Closing down Tegel will have health benefits for hundreds of thousands in the approach path.
a5: These areas will be upgraded economically due to these factors (housing health and employment).
a6: After the new BER Airport has been commissioned, Tegel should definitely be closed.
