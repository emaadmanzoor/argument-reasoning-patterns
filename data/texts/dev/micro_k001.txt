Should only those viewers pay a TV licence fee who actually want to watch programs offered by public broadcasters?

a1: Not everyone should be obliged to pay the TV & radio licence.
a2: Particularly the younger generations are no longer dependent on the programming of public broadcasters.
a3: US series are preferred over “Tatort”,
a4: and online magazines are turned to instead of the “Tagesthemen”.
a5: The TV & radio licence enables economically independent journalism.
a6: But as long as the licence payers have no say in the distribution of the funds, the fee quite rightly annoys them.
