Should shopping malls generally be allowed to open on holidays and Sundays?

a1: Supermarket employees and people who work in shopping centres also have the right to a Sunday off work.
a2: Likewise public holidays should remain what they are: for some a day of introspection, for others a paid day off that is not taken away from the annual paid leave proper.
a3: Hence it is good when shops are not open on Sundays and public holidays.
a4: People, however, who work during the week and on Saturdays then have a problem: everyone else can shop weekdays, but they can't.
a5: For those people the late opening hours, which meanwhile already extend to 12:00 midnight, present a good alternative.
