Should the fine for leaving dog excrements on sideways be increased?

a1: If there were higher fines for leaving dog dirt on pavements, there would presumably be less dog dirt,
a2: which in turn would result in generally clean pavements.
a3: Higher fines may not be ideal, particularly for financially weaker individuals,
a4: but cleaning up after their dogs does happen to be the obligation of the owners.
