# Deep Argumentative Structure Annotations
With this corpus, we compose a list of predefined patterns for explaining argumentative relations that cover a majority of explanations, which incorporates a deep structure annotation for argumentative relations that achieves good annotator agreement.
The corpus is created using brat and the annotation is in the brat standoff format (see http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html). The configuration files for viewing with brat is also included in corpus.
The annotated data is found in the following files:
- data
  - dev: 20 annotated arg-microtext corpus texts used for development
  - test: 67 annotated arg-microtext corpus texts
