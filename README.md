# Deep Argumentative Structure Annotations
With this corpus, we compose a list of predefined patterns for explaining argumentative relations that cover a majority of explanations. Our corpus incorporates a deep structure annotation on top of the arg-microtext corpus (ref: https://github.com/peldszus/arg-microtexts ) for argumentative relations that achieves good annotator agreement.

The corpus is created using brat, and the annotation is in the brat standoff format (see http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html). The configuration files for viewing with brat is also included in the corpus.

# Data
The annotated data may be found in the following folders:
  - dev: 20 annotated arg-microtext corpus texts used for development
  - test: 69 annotated arg-microtext corpus texts
