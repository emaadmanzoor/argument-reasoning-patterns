# Argument Reasoning Pattern (ARP) Corpus
The ARP corpus is composed of a list of predefined patterns for explaining argumentative relations that cover a majority of explanations. Our corpus incorporates a deep structure annotation on top of the arg-microtext corpus (ref: https://github.com/peldszus/arg-microtexts ) for argumentative relations that achieves good annotator agreement.

The ARP corpus is created using brat, and the annotation is in the brat standoff format (see http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html). The configuration files for viewing with brat is also included in this repository.

# Data
The annotated data may be found in the following folders:
  - dev: 20 annotated arg-microtext corpus texts used for creating the templates used in the final experiment.
  - test: 69 annotated arg-microtext corpus texts used for evaluating the feasibility of the templates.
